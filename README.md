# Rock Canyon Design Storefront

[My Notes](notes.md)

Rock Canyon Design is a company that my mom recently started to sell custom handcrafted laser-cut creations. When I told her I was developing my web programming skills, she asked if I would design a website that would:
1. Showcase her products through professional photos and videos.
2. Provide a simple and secure way for customers to browse and purchase products.
3. Allow customers to customize details in certain patterns to order individualized products.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for the application. Several HTML pages. Hyperlink to send email to admin.
- **CSS** - Application styling to work on desktop screens as well as mobile devices, good usage of whitespace, color, and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, fetches product data, handle state changes like adding something to the cart, or opening the Admin-customer live chat.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
      -login
      -cart and order price calculations
      -calculations to apply discounts
- **DB/Login** - Customers can create accounts and log in to purchase items or view their order history. These details will be stored in the database.
- **WebSocket** - Facilitate a live chat between Admin users and customers.

## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I set up the public IP address, the domain name, and the secure https connection.

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [Rock Canyon Design](https://startup.rockcanyondesign.com).

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **HTML pages** - I added several custom HTML pages
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I used header, body, div, and footer on each page.
- [x] **Links** - Each page has a link to each other page.
- [x] **Text** - I added in some text, I will likely adjust it.
- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - I added in a placeholder for API on the purchase page.
- [x] **Images** - I put in some images that will be used and a lot of placeholder images.
- [x] **Login placeholder** - I have a login placeholder.
- [x] **DB data placeholder** - There are a LOT of placeholders for database info.
- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - I added in a couple of potential WebSocket add-ons for later, I might adjust my plans but the placeholders are in for now.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Using CSS and the CSS framework, bootstrap, I made the elements in the header, footer, and main content look better. It's still a work in progress, but it looks much better than it did when it was just HTML.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - I made the navigation elements more clear and made it so you can tell what button you are hovering over and what page you are currently on.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - I made the window size flexible so it works with mobile or desktop or other window sizes. Most of the items on the pages are responsive as well. The objects that aren't responsive yet are just placeholders.
- [x] **Application elements** - I added in placeholders for a better way to display products with a link that will be able to lead to the specific product in the future. I also added in a featured product display that will be interactive in the future.
- [x] **Application text content** - I worked with the CSS file until I got the text to be a font that I liked and to align correctly in the page regardless of the window size.
- [x] **Application images** - I used CSS to make sure the images didn't align in weird ways with the text.

Before further polishing, I want to consult with my mom and see what she wants her website to look like. I don't want to spend a lot of effort making something look pretty that I may just have to scrap completely.
